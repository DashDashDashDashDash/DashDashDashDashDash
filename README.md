### Hello

I'm a system administrator currently localized in Brazil. Currently studying for a bachelors' degree in Computer Science, with an estimate of graduation in 2027.

Currently reading [the-sysadmin-book.com](https://the-sysadmin-book.com/). It's good.

Be aware about CompTIA here: [ðŸ“¢ STOP PAYING COMPTIA FOR A+ CERTIFICATIONS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSW0Wg32QNI) | [Am I wrong about CompTIA?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmV8eAtXc3s)
